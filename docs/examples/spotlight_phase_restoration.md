# Spotlight Phase Restoration

This page explains what `restore_spotlight_phase.py` does and why it is a
prerequisite for interferometric processing of Capella spotlight SLCs.

## Background: spotlight deramping

SAR acquisitions collected in spotlight mode steer the antenna beam in the
azimuth direction. This increases the dwell time, and consequently the
resolution, but the rotation of the antenna beam produces a linear
frequency variation in the received signal. The blue boxes in the
time-frequency diagram below show the natural spectral support of the raw
data: a tilted band whose instantaneous Doppler frequency changes linearly
with slow time `t`.

```
             f_D                              f_D
              |        raw                     |        focused
              | ↗↗↗↗↗↗                         |  ████████
              |↗↗↗↗↗↗↗  ← f_DC^raw             |  ████████  ← basebanded
              |↗↗↗↗↗↗   (linearly varying)     |  ████████
  ────────────+──────────── t       ═►  ───────+──────────── t
              |                                |
              |                                |
```

To keep the product compact, the Capella processor applies a **deramping
and basebanding** step during focusing. The deramp multiplies the signal
by a complex exponential whose instantaneous frequency cancels the linear
Doppler variation, so the focused SLC has its spectrum centered at zero.
The orange boxes above correspond to that focused / basebanded data.

The spectrogram of an example Capella spotlight SLC over Rosamond, CA
illustrates the result: the Doppler spectrum sits at baseband and shows no
linear drift across azimuth blocks.

## Why the phase has to be restored

The deramping step is a *pixel-wise* multiplication by a geometry-dependent
complex exponential, so it mutates the phase of every pixel. Interferometric
techniques (InSAR, phase linking, persistent scatterers, ...) rely on the
SLC phase being the two-way propagation phase, `-4π/λ · R`, between the
antenna and the scatterer. The deramped SLC no longer carries that phase,
so we must restore it before forming interferograms.

For a ground target `P`, the phase that was removed is

$$
\phi_P \;=\; -\frac{4\pi}{\lambda}\,\bigl(R - R_0\bigr)
\;=\; -\frac{4\pi}{\lambda}\,\Bigl(\bigl|\mathrm{ARP} - P\bigr| \;-\; \bigl|\mathrm{ARP} - P_0\bigr|\Bigr)
$$

where

- `ARP` is the **Antenna Reference Position** (ECEF, from the SLC metadata
  field `reference_antenna_position`),
- `P_0` is the **Scene Reference Point** (ECEF, metadata field
  `reference_target_position`),
- `P` is the ECEF position of each ground target under a pixel,
- `R_0 = |ARP - P_0|` is a single scalar — the slant range from the
  antenna to the scene reference point,
- `R = |ARP - P|` is the slant range to the pixel's target.

The restored SLC is obtained by multiplying the deramped data by
`exp(-1j · φ_P)`, which undoes the deramping and returns it to zero-Doppler
geometry:

```python
restored = deramped * np.exp(-1j * phi_P)
```

The two reference positions (`ARP` and `P_0`) are annotated directly in the
SLC metadata by the Capella processor, so the only missing ingredient is
`P` — the ground position of every pixel.

## Getting `P` for every pixel

We need the ECEF coordinates of the target point underneath each SLC pixel.
That is exactly what `isce3.geometry.Rdr2Geo.topo` ("rdr2geo") computes
given the radar grid, orbit, and a DEM: it intersects each range / azimuth
ray with the DEM surface and writes the resulting `lon / lat / height`
rasters.

`restore_spotlight_phase.py` runs rdr2geo on the input SLC using the
capella-reader → isce3 adapters (`get_radar_grid`, `get_orbit`), producing
a 3-band geometry VRT (band 1 = longitude, band 2 = latitude, band 3 =
height). The restoration step then reads those bands block by block,
converts `(lon, lat, height)` to ECEF via the WGS84 ellipsoid, evaluates
`φ_P`, and multiplies the SLC.

## Pipeline

`restore_spotlight_phase.py` executes three steps:

1. **DEM** — if `--dem-file` is omitted, a Copernicus DEM covering the SLC
   footprint (plus a small buffer) is downloaded via
   [`sardem`](https://github.com/scottstanie/sardem).
2. **Geometry** — run `isce3.geometry.Rdr2Geo` on the SLC's radar grid and
   orbit, producing per-pixel lon / lat / height rasters and stacking
   them into a 3-band `geometry.vrt`.
3. **Phase restoration** — open the SLC and the geometry VRT, and for
   each row block:
   - read `lon`, `lat`, `height`, and the complex SLC tile;
   - convert to ECEF target positions (`llh_to_ecef_wgs84`);
   - compute `φ_P` with `compute_restoration_phase`;
   - multiply by `exp(-1j · φ_P)` and write the corrected tile.

   The Capella `TIFFTAG_IMAGEDESCRIPTION` tag is copied across so the
   restored GeoTIFF stays readable by `CapellaSLC.from_file`.

## Usage

```bash
# Auto-downloads a Copernicus DEM over the SLC footprint
python docs/examples/restore_spotlight_phase.py SPOTLIGHT.tif

# Or provide your own DEM in EPSG:4326
python docs/examples/restore_spotlight_phase.py SPOTLIGHT.tif \
    --dem-file my_dem.tif \
    --output-dir restore_out \
    --output SPOTLIGHT.restored.tif
```

After restoration the SLC can be fed into a normal InSAR coregistration
pipeline such as `coregister_isce3.py`.

## Key functions

- `SpotlightGeometry.from_capella_slc` — pull `ARP`, `P_0`, and `λ` from
  the SLC metadata.
- `llh_to_ecef_wgs84` — geodetic → ECEF via the WGS84 ellipsoid.
- `compute_restoration_phase` — evaluate
  `-4π/λ · (|ARP - P| - R_0)` for an array of ECEF target points.
- `apply_spotlight_phase_restoration` — block-wise I/O loop that ties it
  all together and writes a corrected complex64 GeoTIFF.
